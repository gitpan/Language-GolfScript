Language-GolfScript v0.02
-------------------------

Language::GolfScript is a Pure Perl implementation of the
GolfScript programming language. GolfScript is a stack
oriented esoteric language aimed at solving problems
with short programs. The original GolfScript implementation
was by Darren Smith in the Ruby programming language.
More information about the GolfScript language and its
Ruby implementation are available at

    http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript/

The  Language::GolfScript  package contains the full
GolfScript implementation. This module also installs
a package simply called  G  which can wrap a source
code file into the  Language::GolfScript  parser.
This will allow you to evaluate GolfScript code
from the command line. That is,

    perl -MG my_golfscript_file.gs

should produce the same output as

    ruby golfscript.rb my_golfscript_file.gs

except it is 10 fewer characters!


DEBUGGING GOLFSCRIPT

The  Language::GolfScript  language has logging facilities to
show you what the GolfScript interpreter is doing and to
help test and debug your GolfScript code. To use debugging,
pass the "debug" or "verbose" parameters to either the
Language::GolfScript  or  G  modules:

    $ perl -MG -e "4 3+"
    7

    $ perl -MG=debug -e "4 3+"
    Stack initialized:
    Evaluating: 4 3+
    
        Parsing: "4"
    push [1]: 4
        Parsing: " "
        Parsing: "3"
    push [2]: 3
        Parsing: "+"
    pop [2]: 3
    pop [1]: 4
    push [1]: 7
        Parsing: "
    "
    7

    $ perl -MG=verbose "4 3+"
    Stack initialized:
    Evaluating: 4 3+
    
        Parsing: "4"
    push [1]: 4
    
    STACK[0]: ""
    STACK[1]: 4
    
        Parsing: " "
        Parsing: "3"
    push [2]: 3
    
    STACK[0]: ""
    STACK[1]: 4
    STACK[2]: 3
    
        Parsing: "+"
    pop [2]: 3
    
    STACK[0]: ""
    STACK[1]: 4
    
    pop [1]: 4
    
    STACK[0]: ""
    
    push [1]: 7
    
    STACK[0]: ""
    STACK[1]: 7
    
        Parsing: "
    "
    7
